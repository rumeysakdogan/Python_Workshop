## Instructions
You are going to write a program that adds to a `travel_log`. You can see a `travel_log` which is a List that contains 2 Dictionaries.

Write a function that will work with the following line of code on line 21 to add the entry for Russia to the `travel_log`.

```python
add_new_country("Russia", 2, ["Moscow", "Saint Petersburg"])
```
You've visited Russia 2 times.

You've been to Moscow and Saint Petersburg.

DO NOT modify the travel_log directly. You need to create a function that modifies it.
