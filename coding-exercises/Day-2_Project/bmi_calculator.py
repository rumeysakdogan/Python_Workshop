# Instructions:
# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
#
# The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g.
# If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.
#
# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

h = float(height)
w = int(weight)

bmi = w / (h * h)

print(round(bmi))
